# Bisection-Method
Object Oriented implementation of the Bisectional method in C++. 

See the Bisection_Method PDF for a brief Mathematical Introduction to the Bisection Method. The 3 Attached Graph methods were generated usign the Gnuplot Application, and show the functions checked on their associated intervals. 

In this project, we create Bisection Objects, with interval limit attributes, and tolerance attributes. Each object has a findRoot method, which is overloaded to check a default function (Shown in Graph_1), and to be abel to check provided double type functions. We check Graph_2/3 functions in this project, and find the roots accurately.
